**Early tumor detection is the key to surviving cancer and thriving after** <br>
Submission for FHS 3rd Annual Hackathon.

This project was initiated because of the significant importance of brain cancer as a pressing issue. Brain cancer, including gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary tumors, affects countless individuals and their families around the world. It is a devastating disease that can have profound effects on physical, emotional, and cognitive well-being. Understanding the causes, effects, and available treatments for these brain tumors is crucial for raising awareness, promoting early detection, and improving patient outcomes.

By exploring the causes of these tumors, we can work towards identifying risk factors and developing preventive strategies. Understanding the effects of brain cancer helps us recognize the impact it has on individuals' lives, guiding efforts to provide appropriate support and care for patients. Additionally, knowledge of the available treatments helps healthcare professionals and patients make informed decisions about managing and combating these tumors effectively.
